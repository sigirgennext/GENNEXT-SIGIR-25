# GENNEXT@SIGIR 2025

**The 1st Workshop on Next-Generation IR and Recommender Systems with LLM-based Language Agents (GENNEXT@SIGIR'25)**  
*Colocated with the 48th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR 2025) in Padua, Italy*

---

## Home

Large Language Models (LLMs) and other generative architectures are rapidly reshaping the fields of Information Retrieval (IR) and Recommender Systems (RS). Advanced _language agents_—which combine LLMs with specialized tool usage, multi-turn dialogue, and domain knowledge—unlock new capabilities such as context-sensitive retrieval, personalized generation, and adaptive conversation flows.

Despite the potential benefits, these generative models introduce new challenges in terms of **hallucination**, **bias/fairness**, **data privacy**, **security**, and **evaluation methodologies**. **GENNEXT** aims to explore the intersection of LLM-based **language agents**, **generative content creation**, and **conversational AI** in IR and RS—focusing on risks, opportunities, and novel forms of evaluation and user interaction.

Our workshop builds upon the success of the [ROEGEN@RecSys'24](https://roegen-recsys2024.github.io/) event but broadens the scope to include more general information retrieval, next-generation recommendation, and tool-augmented LLMs.

## Call for Papers

We invite researchers and practitioners to submit work related (but not limited) to:
- **LLM-driven IR and Recommender Systems**: Prompting, in-context learning, foundation models, or domain-adaptive fine-tuning for IR/RS.
- **Agentic Tool Usage**: Techniques enabling LLMs to call external APIs (e.g., knowledge bases, retrieval models, recommendation engines) to fulfill user queries.
- **Conversational and Dialogue Systems**: Multi-turn interactions, user modeling, dynamic preference elicitation, explanation, or negotiation with generative AI.
- **Generative Content Creation**: Novel item generation (text, images, music), creative item repurposing, or integrated retrieval-plus-generation frameworks.
- **Bias and Fairness, Privacy, and Ethics**: Identifying and mitigating biases in generative models, ensuring privacy, building trust, and tackling hallucination risks.
- **Evaluation Metrics and Benchmarks**: Designing new metrics or user study protocols that capture the interplay of generative quality, recommendation relevance, and ethical concerns.

### Submission Guidelines

- **Full Papers**: **Up to 8 pages** (excluding references). These should present substantial research, theoretical analyses, or comprehensive surveys.
- **Short Papers**: **Up to 4 pages** (excluding references). Suitable for work-in-progress, preliminary findings, or new concepts.
- **Extended Abstracts**: **2–3 pages** (excluding references). For late-breaking results, vision papers, and discussion proposals.

Submissions must be **anonymized** and follow the official [ACM two-column SIGCONF template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).  
All submissions will undergo **double-blind peer review** and be evaluated for relevance, originality, and technical quality.

We plan to publish the accepted papers in an open-access proceedings venue (e.g., CEUR-WS). Select high-quality submissions may be invited for extended versions in a journal special issue.
